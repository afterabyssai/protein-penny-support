## Step 2: Figma Make Prompt (Do This After)

Once GitHub page is live, use this prompt in Figma Make:
```
Add a delete account feature to the Profile Settings screen:

1. At the bottom of the Profile Settings screen (below the Save button), add a red text link that says "Delete Account"

2. When clicked, show a confirmation dialog with:
   - Title: "Delete Account?"
   - Message: "This will permanently delete all your data including your food logs, custom foods, favorites, and settings. This cannot be undone."
   - Two buttons: "Cancel" (gray) and "Delete My Account" (red)

3. When "Delete My Account" is clicked, trigger a deleteAccount() function (the developer will implement the API call)

Style the delete button in red (#d9534f) to indicate it's a destructive action.
